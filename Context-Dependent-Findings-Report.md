## üìà Major Findings

### 1. Methylation-miRNA Context Interactions
- **Total interactions analyzed**: 8,781
- **Context-dependent interactions**: 1,862 (21.2%)
- **Mean improvement from interaction**: 10.8%
- **Context strength**: 0.390 (moderate to strong)
- **Context direction**: Both positive and negative effects observed

**Biological Significance**: DNA methylation's regulatory effect on genes significantly changes depending on miRNA levels, suggesting miRNAs act as contextual switches that modify epigenetic regulation.
